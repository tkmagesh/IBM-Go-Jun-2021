The Paradox of Choice (Barry Schwartz) (TED )

Why?
    Performance (Runtime)
    Easy to learn
    Community Support
    Concurrency friendly (better performance, better memory footprint)

    Simplicity
        - 25 keywords
        - package, import, var, func, return, if, for, switch, select, range, chan, close, defer, go, type, interface, struct, make
        - NO list
            no classes
            no inheritance (prefer composition over inheritance)
            no access modifiers
            no generics

    Built for concurrency
        Concurrency features are built in the language
            go, chan (built in DATA TYPE), range, select 
        Builtin Scheduler 
        1000s of goroutines using 1 thread (extremely memory effiencient when compared the traditional multi threading techniques)
